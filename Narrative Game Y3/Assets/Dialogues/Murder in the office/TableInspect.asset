  text: A monument of rich mahogany. Commanding a presence at the centre of the room.
    Nobody has any practical use for a desk this large. Its right corner unphased
    by the clash with its owners skull. There's a small picture frame face down on
    the desk. It looks like Mr Tulip and his wife, both struggling to muster much
    of a smile.
