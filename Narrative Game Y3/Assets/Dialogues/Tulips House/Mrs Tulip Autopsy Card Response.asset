    husband has a mistress. It\u2019s a thought you try your hardest to cast aside.
    But it clings and festers. Every so often he\u2019d come home late. He\u2019d
    say he had to stay at work, but I could smell the wine on his breath. You learn
    to ignore these things as best you can, for your own sake."
